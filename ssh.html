<h2> log into B as b from A as a without password</h2>

## sudo syntax ##
ssh -t user@hostname sudo command
ssh -t user@hostname 'sudo command1 arg1 arg2'


## su syntax ##
ssh user@nas01 su -c "/path/to/command1 arg1 arg2"

# RHEL/CentOS specific #
ssh user@nas01 su --session-command="/path/to/command1 arg1 arg2"
ssh vivek@nixcraft.home.server su --session-command="/sbin/service httpd restart"

How to do it

First log in on A as user a and generate a pair of authentication keys. Do not enter a passphrase:


a@A:~> ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/a/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Created directory '/home/a/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/a/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/a/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
3e:4f:05:79:3a:9f:96:7c:3b:ad:e9:58:37:bc:37:e4 a@A



Now use ssh to create a directory ~/.ssh as user b on B. (The directory may already exist, which is fine):


a@A:~> ssh b@B mkdir -p .ssh
b@B's password:



Finally append a's new public key to b@B:.ssh/authorized_keys and enter b's password one last time:


a@A:~> cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh b@B 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
b@B's password:



From now on you can log into B as b from A as a without password:


a@A:~> ssh b@B



A note depending on your version of SSH you might also have to do the following changes:

- Put the public key in .ssh/authorized_keys2
- Change the permissions of .ssh to 700
- Change the permissions of .ssh/authorized_keys2 to 640
